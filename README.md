- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a B.Tech graduate from IIT Bhilai.

- ğŸ‘€ I have experience in Machine Learning(CNN) model development and their Integration. 
- ğŸŒ± I love playing with Unix OSs(servers in particular) to the point, I have an rpi 5 working as a dedicated server. although not powerful but it's a under budget server.
